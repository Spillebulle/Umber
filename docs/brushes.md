# Brushes

How Umber's brush library is put together, what an imported brush keeps, and
what it loses.

## The library, in three parts

| Part | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Umber's own five presets | `umber_defaults` in `crates/umber-core/src/preset.rs` | by hand |
| The imported set | `crates/umber-core/assets/builtin-brushes.ron`, embedded with `include_str!` | the generator, below |
| The user's own | `%APPDATA%\Umber\data\brushes\` (Windows), `~/.local/share/umber/brushes/` (Linux), `~/Library/Application Support/Umber/brushes/` (macOS) | the app, at runtime |

The first two together are `umber_core::preset::builtin()`, a `&'static
[BrushPreset]` parsed once. The third is `umber_core::preset::UserLibrary`.

They are kept apart on purpose. The shipped library is replaced wholesale by an
update; anything the user saved into it would be lost. The user library is never
written by the build.

## The user library is a directory

```text
brushes/
    brushes.ron     the presets — exactly the format it always was
    tips/
        <name>.png  one 8-bit greyscale coverage mask per bitmap tip
```

It used to be the `brushes.ron` alone. A bitmap tip does not go in a text file,
so a stamp brush could be loaded and painted with but never *saved*, which is
what blocked every stamp-based pack.

A directory rather than a zip. Three reasons, heaviest first:

- **A write touches only what changed.** The library is rewritten on every
  edit — save, rename, delete, import — so a rename costs a few kilobytes of
  RON. In a zip it would cost the whole archive, tips and all.
- **The atomic write keeps working.** `UserLibrary::write` writes the RON beside
  itself and renames over the old one, so an interrupted write cannot leave a
  truncated collection. The same trick on a zip would mean rewriting every mask
  to change a name, and risking the masks along with the index.
- **The tips are ordinary pictures.** A stamp's whole content is an image;
  opening, replacing or copying one with anything that opens an image is worth
  more than tidiness.

`BrushPreset::tip` holds the mask's *name*, not the mask. That is what lets two
brushes cut from one stamp share a file and a single GPU upload — and what makes
a name resolving to nothing a brush that paints round rather than a library that
will not load. An Umber `.ron` exported and re-imported elsewhere therefore
arrives round: the text carries the reference, not the picture, and
`UserLibrary::import_file` drops a reference it cannot resolve rather than
leaving one dangling.

### Migrating

A `brushes.ron` sitting where the directory now goes — every library written
before this — is read on first load and written into the new layout. **The
original is left where it is.** A migration that deletes the only copy of
somebody's collection has to be right first time, and this one does not have to
be; an older Umber on the same machine also keeps working, at the price of the
two copies diverging from then on. The library says so once, in the Brushes
panel, and never again.

`a_flat_library_is_migrated_into_the_directory` and
`a_directory_that_already_has_brushes_ignores_the_old_file` are the guards.

## Refreshing the shipped library

```sh
pwsh tools/fetch-brushes.ps1     # or: sh tools/fetch-brushes.sh
cargo run -p umber-core --example build-brush-library
```

The first step downloads the packs into `assets/brushes/`, which is git-ignored,
and records what it took in `assets/brushes/LICENSES.md`, which is not. The
second converts them and rewrites `builtin-brushes.ron`. Both steps are
deliberate acts rather than a `build.rs`: the packs are not in the repository,
so a build script would make a clean checkout unbuildable, and a generated file
that lands in a commit is a file whose diff can be read.

Preview thumbnails are never downloaded. In the MyPaint pack the brush
*settings* are CC0 but some of the previews are CC-BY, and not having the files
is the surest way not to ship them.

## What is in it today

**All 196** MyPaint brushes, plus Umber's own five: 201 presets, every one CC0.

It was 128 for a while. The 68 missing were refused by the generator rather than
lost by accident, and both reasons were engine gaps rather than import gaps:

| Was refused | Count | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `smudge >= 0.5` | 67 | The stroke carries a colour per dab and samples the canvas asynchronously. See the colour-pickup section of `CLAUDE.md`. |
| time-based dabs only | 2 | The dab loop has a time term, so an airbrush keeps depositing while the pen is held still. |

(One was refused on both counts, hence 68 rather than 69.)

`umber_core::brushimport::mypaint::unsupported_features` is still the check, and
it still lists `colorize` and `lock_alpha`, which nothing in this pack uses. It
is deliberately separate from the importer: a user who asks for a specific file
should get whatever the importer can make of it, with a note saying what was
dropped. The generator is the fussy one, because it decides what Umber *claims*
to support.

## How the library is grouped

By **style**, not by pack — `umber_core::style`. A pack arrives sorted by
whoever drew it, which is the right way to credit it and the wrong way to browse
it: nobody reaches for a brush by remembering the artist, and author-grouping
put the pencils in six different collections.

Authorship is not lost. It travels on the brush in `BrushPreset::credit` and the
browser prints it under every name, which is also what satisfies CC-BY should a
pack ever need it.

Twelve collections, in the order the picker lists them:

| Collection | Count |
|---|---|
| Pencils & sketching | 12 |
| Inks & pens | 30 |
| Markers | 6 |
| Charcoal, chalk & pastel | 6 |
| Paint & brushes | 45 |
| Watercolour & wet media | 22 |
| Airbrush & spray | 11 |
| Blenders & smudge | 23 |
| Erasers | 8 |
| Texture & grain | 11 |
| Foliage & fur | 8 |
| Effects & experimental | 19 |

The generator prints this table on every run, because a classifier is a
judgement and judgements have to be looked at rather than asserted. The first
attempt sorted on `smudge >= 0.5` before consulting the name and put 68 brushes
in "Blenders" — MyPaint's oil paints all mix with what is under them, so the
setting says far less than it appears to. Erasing is the only setting that now
overrides a name; see the module docs for the rest of the ordering.

## What conversion keeps

`.myb` is JSON. MyPaint evaluates each setting as

```text
value = base_value + Σ mapping_i(input_i)
```

— the input mappings are **added** to the base value, not multiplied by it.

| MyPaint | Umber |
|---|---|
| `radius_logarithmic` | `size`, `min_size_ratio`, `size_curve` |
| `hardness` | `hardness` |
| `opaque` × `opaque_multiply` | `opacity`, `opacity_curve`, `pressure_opacity` |
| `dabs_per_actual_radius` + `dabs_per_basic_radius` | `spacing` |
| `eraser` | `mode` |
| `slow_tracking` | `stabilization` |

`radius_logarithmic` is the natural log of the dab radius **in pixels**, and its
pressure mapping is an offset in log space, so the radius at pressure *p* is
`exp(base + map(p))`. The classic mis-import is to read the base value as a
radius: it turns a 2.6 px pen into a 0.96 px one. `classic/pen` has a base of
0.96 and a pressure mapping to +0.5, so Umber stores a size of 8.61 px, a
minimum ratio of `exp(-0.5) = 0.607`, and a size curve that reproduces
MyPaint's radius exactly at all five sample points. There is a test for that:
`the_imported_radius_matches_mypaint_at_every_sample`.

## What conversion loses

Documented in full in the module docs of
`crates/umber-core/src/brushimport/mypaint.rs`. The short version, worst first:

- **Shape driven by an input rather than a base value.** The dab is now an
  ellipse with scatter and radius jitter, so most shaped brushes arrive shaped —
  109 of the 196. What does not carry across is a brush whose `elliptical_dab_
  ratio`, `offset_by_random` or `radius_by_random` is driven by a *mapping*
  (pressure, random, speed) rather than stated as a base value: the importer
  reads the base and ignores the mapping, so 23 brushes that vary their
  ellipticity dynamically import as round ones. `Brush` has exactly two
  pressure-driven curves and nowhere to put a third.
- **Speed-driven scatter.** `offset_by_speed`. The constant part of a brush's
  scatter comes across as `Brush::scatter`; the part that grows with how fast
  the pen is moving has nowhere to go, so a spray that opens out on a fast
  stroke keeps one width.
- **Bitmap tips.** MyPaint has none either — a `.myb` is always a round dab, so
  nothing is lost here. The engine and the library now have them (see below);
  it is the Krita and GIMP packs they exist for.
- **Non-pressure inputs.** `speed1`, `speed2`, `random`, `stroke`, `tilt`.
  `Brush` has exactly two pressure-driven parameters and nowhere to put the
  rest. `direction` is the one exception: it is not read as a curve, but a
  `direction` mapping on `elliptical_dab_angle` is taken as "this dab turns to
  follow the stroke", which is the difference between a rake and a broad nib.
- **Opacity build-up.** MyPaint composites each dab, so a low-opacity brush
  darkens as a stroke crosses itself. Umber takes a `max` of coverage across the
  whole stroke and applies opacity once at commit — that is the wet-layer design
  in `CLAUDE.md`, and it is why `opaque_linearize` is ignored rather than
  approximated. A MyPaint wash and an Umber wash of the same numbers will not
  look the same.

## Bitmap tips

The dab pass can stamp an 8-bit coverage mask instead of its procedural round
falloff. This is what the stamp-based packs need.

`umber_core::tip::TipMask` is the mask — plain bytes, `0` no paint and `255`
full, so the engine keeps no GPU types. `CanvasRenderer::set_tip` uploads one to
an `R8Unorm` texture and flips a flag in the dab uniforms.

Three things about the design are load-bearing:

- **The tip is bound per pass, not per dab.** A stroke has one brush, so one
  tip covers the whole dab pass and a thousand tipped dabs are still a single
  draw call. Set it between strokes; changing it mid-stroke would restamp what
  is already in the scratch under a new shape.
- **The tip modulates coverage; it does not composite.** The blend state is
  untouched and still `max`, so a tipped stroke saturates at 1.0 under overlap
  exactly as a round one does and stroke opacity is still applied once, at
  commit. `a_tipped_stamp_still_saturates_under_overlap` is the guard, and it is
  a deliberate copy of `overlapping_dabs_do_not_compound` rather than an
  extension of it.
- **The round path is untouched.** The shader samples the tip unconditionally —
  `textureSample` may not sit in non-uniform control flow — and then `select`s
  between it and the falloff. With no tip the binding is a 1×1 placeholder whose
  contents are discarded. Every pre-existing GPU test still passes unchanged,
  which is the evidence.

A fourth thing, about the *stroke* rather than the pass: `set_tip` is called
from `UmberApp::start_stroke` and nowhere else, and it early-outs when the mask
is the same `Arc` as last time. Identity rather than equality — masks are shared
out of the library, so two brushes cut from one stamp really are one allocation,
and comparing a megabyte of coverage to answer "same brush?" would put back the
cost the check exists to avoid. Without it a texture allocation and a copy land
on the first frame of every stroke, which is the one moment this project exists
to keep short. `a_second_brush_with_a_different_tip_replaces_the_first` guards
the failure direction, which is a *stale* tip.

## Importing a GIMP brush

`umber_core::brushimport::gbr::from_gbr` decodes a `.gbr` into a `TipMask`, plus
the brush name and the spacing the format carries. Everything in it is
big-endian; a little-endian read reports a billion-pixel brush and is caught by
the length check rather than producing garbage.

`read_file` accepts `.gbr` alongside `.myb` and `.ron`, so **Import brushes…**
in the Brushes panel reads one, saves the mask into `tips/`, and selects the
brush — importing a brush is asking to paint with it, and a stamp is
unrecognisable in a list and obvious the moment it makes a mark.

`gbr::to_brush` decides the rest of the `Brush`, which the format does not carry:

| From the file | Becomes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| mask width and height | `size`, after padding to a square | a stamp lands at its original scale until you say otherwise |
| spacing, per cent | `spacing` | GIMP's default of 10 % is Umber's default too |
| spacing of **0** | the default, not 1 % | GIMP's own control cannot go below 1, so a zero is a writer that never filled the field in; taken literally it turns a 500 px stamp into five-pixel steps |
| — | `pressure_size` and `pressure_opacity` **off** | a `.gbr` carries no dynamics, and GIMP stamps one at a constant size |

The mask is padded to a square rather than given a `dab_ratio`. The dab spreads
a tip over its bounding box, so an unpadded portrait stamp comes out squashed;
the ratio's long axis is the dab's *x* axis, so preserving proportions with it
would mean rotating a portrait mask a quarter turn and rotating it back with
`dab_angle`. Padding is exact, needs no rotation, and leaves `dab_ratio` free
for the user to squash a stamp deliberately. It costs shading an empty margin,
which for the near-square masks packs actually contain is a few per cent.

A 4-byte `.gbr` is a coloured stamp and imports as its silhouette — the stroke
scratch is one coverage channel by design. `brushimport::dropped_features` says
so, the same way a `.myb` that leans on `colorize` does.

In the brush editor's **Tip** tab a stamp brush shows the mask, its size in
pixels, and a way back to the round dab. **Hardness is drawn dead there**, with
the reason underneath: a tip *replaces* the procedural falloff rather than being
multiplied into it — `select(round, masked, use_tip)` in `dab.wgsl` — so
hardness has nothing left to shape. A round brush shows none of this. Almost
every brush is round, and a permanent row saying so would be a control that
never does anything.

## Not done yet

- **A licensed `.gbr` pack to ship.** The machinery is complete — a stamp brush
  can be imported, saved, reloaded and painted with — but nothing ships with
  one. The one CC0 pack whose licence *is* stated inside the download is a raw
  photographic-texture resource whose brushes rely on GIMP's per-dab build-up,
  which Umber's `max` coverage cannot reproduce; see `docs/brush-sources.md` for
  the measurement. The `.gbr` decoder is tested against files built byte by byte
  in the test module rather than against a real brush.
- **Tips in the *shipped* library.** `BrushPreset::tip` resolves against the
  user's library only. Shipping a stamp would additionally need the masks
  embedded in the binary — a generated `assets/tips/` and an `include_bytes!`
  table beside `builtin-brushes.ron` — and a rule in the generator for which of
  a pack's tips are dense enough to reproduce faithfully. Neither is built,
  because there is nothing yet to point them at.
- **A stamp brush's row in the library looks round.** `widgets::brush_row`
  paints its sample from opacity and hardness, which is what a procedural dab
  is made of. The brush editor shows the mask; the list does not.
- **Grain / paper texture** multiplied into dab coverage.
- **A `.kpp` importer.** Krita presets are PNG files with the settings in a
  text chunk, and most of them lean on a bitmap tip. The tip half is now here;
  the settings half is not.
- **`.gih` animated brushes**, a `.gbr` sequence. One tip is bound per stroke,
  so there is nowhere to put the other frames.

See `docs/brush-sources.md` for the packs that were considered and why the ones
that are missing are missing.
